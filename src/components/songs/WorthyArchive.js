        Let mercy be written on my heart Lord
        <br />
        I’ll be Your scroll, You’ll be my scribe
        <br />
        Inscribe Your laws within my heart
        <br />
        Elohim with grace poured into Your lips
        <br />
        Word of God come be my inker
        <br />
        I’ll be Your witness
        <br />
        <br />
        Like the three that bear witness on earth
        <br />
        The Spirit, water and the blood
        <br />
        They agree in one
        <br />
        Likewise the three in heaven
        <br />
        <br />
        They bear You record
        <br />
        The Father, Word and the Holy Ghost
        <br />
        And these three are one
