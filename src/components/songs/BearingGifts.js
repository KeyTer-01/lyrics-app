        Weâ€™ve received of the gift of the Holy Ghost
        <br />
        As the Spirit wills
        <br />
        You have measured it out unto us
        <br />
        And we are edified
        <br />
        By the gifts of the Spirit, we are grateful
        <br />
        <br />
        We are receiving of the Gifts of Christ
        <br />
        Apostles, Prophets, Teachers and Pastors
        <br />
        Evangelists; the graces You have given
        <br />
        According to the measure of the gift of Christ
        <br />
        <br />
        For the perfecting of the saints,
        <br />
        The work of the ministry,
        <br />
        And the edifying of the body
        <br />
        Until we come to the unity of faith
        <br />
        And the stature of the fullness of Christ
