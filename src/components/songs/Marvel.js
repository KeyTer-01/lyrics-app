        Who has known the mind of the Lord?
        <br />
        Who has ever been His counselor?
        <br />
        Who has first given unto Him
        <br />
        That it should be recompensed unto him again?
        <br />
        <br />
        Who can hold the Lord to a ransom?
        <br />
        Who can say to the Lord pay Your debt?
        <br />
        Who has ever given so much to Him
        <br />
        That he should now be to the Lord a creditor?

        Oh how it blows my mind

        Your exceeding merciful heart

        Your love unfathomable
