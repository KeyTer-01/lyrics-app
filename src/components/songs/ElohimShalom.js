        Many, many, many doors abound

        The new and living way

        Bring us again from the dead

        Jesus Christ the Good Shepherd
        <br />
        Indeed, You are the only door there is
        <br />
        Your sheep will hear Your voice
        <br />
        And if any man or angel preach
        <br />
        Another gospel to the sheep
        <br />
        Oh let Him be anathema
