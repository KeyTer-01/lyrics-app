        I will esteem Your word far above my necessary food

        Oh, I won’t lightly esteem You
        <br />
        You the God of my salvation
        <br />
        And my soul will not provoke You to jealousy

        In the waste howling wilderness
        <br />
        Led me about and You instructed me
        <br />
        You kept me as the apple of Your eye

        You are the rock, Your work is perfect
        <br />
        And all Your ways are judgment

        A God of truth and without iniquity
        <br />
        Just and right is He
