        I live in hostility to sin

        I'm a villain to death

        So Eternal Life will prosper here
        <br />
        In Obedience to faith

        Righteousness is reigning here

        Righteousness is reigning here (In my heart)

        I see righteousness is reigning here (In my walk)

        Righteousness is reigning here (In my day)

        We reign in life by Jesus Christ

        We reign in life

        Just as sin came
        <br />
        And death reigned
        <br />
        By one man
        <br />
        So much more we see grace
        <br />
        Through righteousness life reigns

        My everyday will be grace for grace Righteousness is my master now
        <br />
        Sin and death, you won't prosper here

        You will not prosper here
