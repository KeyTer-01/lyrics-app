        This is my song of the morning
        <br />
        My song of the morning
        <br />
        That I sing to the groom
        <br />
        For the whole night through
      </Text>
      <br />
      <Text as={"b"}>Chorus</Text>
      <Text>
        And by the breaking of the day
        <br />
        Let it be said of meThat You have touched my hip
        <br />
        And I have answered Thee
      </Text>
      <br />
      <Text as={"b"}>Verse 1</Text>
      <Text>
        That I have wrestled with You
        <br />
        For the whole night through
        <br />
        Cause I won't let You go
        <br />
        Until You bless my soul
        <br />
        So, when You overcome me
        <br />
        Then I'm an overcomer
        <br />
        For if I lose and You win
        <br />
        Then I will cease from my sins
      </Text>

        By an overflowing scourge
        <br />
        I'll been trodden down
        <br />
        And my covenant with death
        <br />
        Shall be disannulled
        <br />
        And from my slaughter of kings
        <br />
        I'll return with spoils
        <br />
        Then I'll meet with the Priest
        <br />
        Of the Most High God
      </Text>

        Lord You can touch my hip
        <br />
        I know I'll be broken though
        <br />
        Then I will lose my name
        <br />
        And I'll inherit Yours
        <br />
        For me to live is Christ
        <br />
        And to die is gain
        <br />
        So, let the daystar rise
        <br />
        From within my heart

        I will be Jacob no more
        <br />
        I will be Israel forever
        <br />
        Being face to face with God
        <br />
