        Only You can have compassion on the ignorant

        And on them that are out of the way
        <br />
        (You set them on The Everlasting Way)

        <br />
        One who is Holy, blameless, harmless and Undefiled
        <br />
        Oh The Lamb of God
        <br />
        Jesus The Lamb of God
        <br />
        <br />
        The One who is crowned with many crowns
        <br />
        The King of Righteousness, King of Peace
        <br />
        Priest of The Most High God

        Priest of The Most High God

        Without father, without mother
        <br />
        Without natural descent
        <br />
        With neither beginning of days, nor end of life
        <br />
        You abide a Priest continually
