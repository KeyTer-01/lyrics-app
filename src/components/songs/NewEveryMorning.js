        I'm not ashamed of the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ

        For that's where I find my life
        <br />
        And In Jesus name I will rise
        <br />
        <br />
        For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith
        <br />
        I'll be looking on to Jesus
        <br />
        The author and the finisher of my faith
