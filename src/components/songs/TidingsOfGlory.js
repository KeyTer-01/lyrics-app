        There’s a rhythm of glory ringing in my head
        <br />
        A glorious procession of The King
        <br />
        To Him who is seated on the Throne
        <br />
        And I will wait
        <br />
        For the King of glory to speak
        <br />
        To get the right words to say
        <br />
        In the Most Holy place
        <br />
        The praise of my King
        <br />
        Is High, High praises
        <br />
        Two-edged sword in my hand
        <br />
        High Praises of my God

        Of Elohim in this place

        Make His praise glorious

        You can speak in other tongues

        Praise Him in your understanding

        Praise him in tongues
