        Eternal life that sits in the

        The virgins will see far

        Through the veil of His flesh
        <br />
        Jesus, He will make us bold

        To enter into the Holiest of all

        Jesus precious more than gold
        <br />
        You have trapped everything
        <br />
        That we require
        <br />
        In the blood of Your life
