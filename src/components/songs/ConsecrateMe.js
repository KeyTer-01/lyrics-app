        Write your laws upon my heart And not on a stone Come put your laws in
        my mind And make me your own By the word of oath Consecrate me Secrete
        your everlasting covenant

        I'll be your Epistle
        <br />
        Written on your heart
        <br />
        Known and read of the heavens
        <br />
        The manifold wisdom of God
        <br />
        That God has walked with men
        <br />
        And he was not
        <br />
        He's no more to be found in the heavens of angels
        <br />
        Behold the tabernacle of God now is with men

        Your covenant everlasting

        <br />
        Ministration of the High Priest
        <br />
        By the sprinkling of the blood
        <br />
        Of how to love not my life unto the death
        <br />
        And death to overcome
        <br />
        By the blood of the lamb
        <br />
        And by the word of our testimony to ascend
