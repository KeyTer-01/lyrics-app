        That I lost a part of me
        <br />
        At first, so I thought
        <br />
        Then I learnt that
        <br />
        He has been caught up
        <br />
        Into a world so high
        <br />
        Higher than all the heavens put together
        <br />
        He has gone to make a place for me
        <br />
        (For me and you)
        <br />
        But He took my heart with him
        <br />
        Into his banquet hall
        <br />
        And his banner over me is love
      </Text>

      <Text as={"b"}>Chorus</Text>
      <Text>
        I am a mourner I am a weeper
        <br />
        Till my mourning turns to dancing
        <br />
        I will wait
        <br />
        I am a lover
        <br />
        (In case you wondered) I'm just a believer
        <br />
        And its official for the rest of my life
      </Text>
      <br />
      <Text as={"b"}>Reprise</Text>
      <Text>
        What can separate me from the love
        <br />
        The love that I have in Christ Jesus
        <br />
        The Son of the morning soon will come
        <br />
        And all of my mourning will be gone
