        Clear the vomit off the table
        <br />
        Serve the pure milk of the word
        <br />
        You’ve deprived my sheep of pasture
        <br />
        And I won’t have it anymore
        <br />
        <br />
        The Pastors have become so brutish
        <br />
        They don’t seek The Lord
        <br />
        So their sheep I will scatter and
        <br />
        They won’t prosper anymore

        Thus saith The Lord God of Israel
        <br />
        I’ll gather the remnant of my flock
        <br />
        Out of the lands where I’ve driven them
        <br />
        And will bring them again into their fold
        <br />
        These are the days saith The Lord that I’ll
        <br />
        Raise unto David a righteous branch
        <br />
        A King shall prosper and reign and shall
        <br />
        Execute judgement and justice in the earth

        Woe, woe, woe, woe unto the Pastors
        <br />
        That destroy and scatter the sheep
        <br />
        Of My pasture says The Lord
        <br />
        I won’t have it anymore
        <br />
        <br />
        Take heed therefore unto yourselves
        <br />
        And to all the flock over which I’ve made you
        <br />
        Overseers to feed the church
        <br />
        Which I purchased with my blood

        So I will give you the Pastors
        <br />
        That are according to my heart
        <br />
        They will feed You with knowledge
        <br />
        And understanding in my word
        <br />
        <br />
        Precept must be upon precept
        <br />
        Line upon line, line upon line
        <br />
        A little here and a little there
        <br />
        You will follow to know the Lord
