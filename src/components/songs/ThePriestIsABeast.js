        The Priest is a beast
        <br />
        The Priest is a beast
        <br />
        Beast of righteousness
        <br />
        And a beast of peace
        <br />
        <br />
        The Priest is a beast
        <br />
        The Priest is a beast
        <br />
        Beast of mercy
        <br />
        And the beast of joy
        <br />
        <br />
        Clothed with a vesture
        <br />
        Dipped in blood
        <br />
        He will wash us in His own blood
        <br />
        All of His brothers and sisters in blood
        <br />
        <br />
        Redeemed from their kindred
        <br />
        From their people and tribe and tongue
        <br />
        Bringing many sons to glory
        <br />
        As Priests of Christ and God

        The beast is a priest
        <br />
        The beast is a priest
        <br />
        That works abomination
        <br />
        Priest of all things that defiles
        <br />
        <br />
        The beast is a priest
        <br />
        The beast is a priest
        <br />
        Priest of iniquity
        <br />
        And things that maketh a lie
        <br />
        <br />
        See he likes to be hidden
        <br />
        Hidden from the sight of men
        <br />
        But we can see him in his true light
        <br />
        The fallen angel, a creature so vile
        <br />
        <br />
        In the revelation of the Lamb
        <br />
        Is the beast exposed
        <br />
        By the word of our testimony
        <br />
        We overcome by the blood of the Lamb
