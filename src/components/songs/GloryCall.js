        In the beginning man fell short of glory
        <br />
        Death reigned from Adam, from Adam to Moses
        <br />
        Even over them, them that had not sinned
        <br />
        After the similitude of Adam's transgression
        <br />
        <br />
        Who is the figure of him that was to come
        <br />
        Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels
        <br />
        For the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour
        <br />
        That he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.
        <br />
        <br />
        It became him for whom are all things and by whom
        <br />
        By whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory
        <br />
        Made perfect through sufferings captain of our salvation
        <br />
        We're coming to glory, Glory hallelujah

        Adonai is a fountain
