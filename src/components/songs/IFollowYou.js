        What looks like
        <br />
        The valley of the shadow of death
        <br />
        To my mind’s eyes
        <br />
        To my mind's eyes
        <br />
        I realized is only just a tunnel

        Leading me unto Eternal life

        The valley of the shadow of death

        Like the valley of the shadow of death

        To my mind’s eyes
        <br />
        To my mind's eyes

        When I look into the perfect law of liberty I can see now

        Is only just a tunnel leading to Eternal life

        It’s taking me to Eternal life

        These light afflictions
        <br />
        Which is but for a moment is working for us
        <br />
        A far more great and exceeding weight of glory
        <br />
        As we look not at the things that are seen
        <br />
        But at the things that are unseen
        <br />
        For the things that are seen are temporal
        <br />
        But the unseen is Eternal.
