        Behold what manner of love
        <br />
        That the Father has bestowed
        <br />
        Upon us that we should be
        <br />
        Called the sons of God
        <br />
        Therefore, the world does not know us
        <br />
        Because it did not know Him
        <br /> <br />
        Beloved, now are we the sons of God
        <br />
        And it does not yet
        <br />
        Appear, what we shall be
        <br />
        But we know when He shall appear
        <br />
        We will be like Him
        <br />
        For we shall see Him as He is

        We shall see Him as He is
        <br />
        We will know, we will know
        <br />
        We will know as we are known
