        Woman, you know it won't be long

        Oh yes, you should have might to bear
        <br />
        And to fulfil your vows to your husbandman
        <br />
        The lamb of God you hear
        <br />
        For He will wash you with the washing of the water by His word
        <br />
        He will cleanse you
        <br />
        For He is coming to take you into His rest
