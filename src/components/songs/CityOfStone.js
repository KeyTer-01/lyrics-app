        They are lively, lively stones
        <br />
        They are built up a spiritual house
        <br />
        A holy priesthood
        <br />
        To offer up
        <br />
        To offer spiritual sacrifices
        <br />
        Acceptable to God
        <br />
        By Jesus Christ the lamb
        <br />
        Disallowed indeed of men
        <br />
        (but) Chosen of God and precious

        I'm going to become like the stone
        <br />
        Tried and precious corner
        <br />
        Sure foundation enthroned
