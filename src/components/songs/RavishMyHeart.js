        Jesus you know I'm stuck on you
        <br />
        Your love ravaging my heart
        <br />
        Is never over
        <br />
        More than butterflies in my soul
        <br />
        You know I can't explain

        Just what you do to me

        the satisfaction of my soul

        This peaceful loving of your face

        The radiance of your face

        is ever changing me within

        Overcoming all consuming
