        There's this song with many Jesuses occurring
        <br />
        Oh that we had gazillion tongues to sing it all
        <br />
        I won't burst I pray with all these fountains rumbling
        <br />
        Inside of me a cry!
        <br />
        Hail Jesus
        <br />
        Let all Hail Jesus
      </Text>
      <br />
      <Text as={"b"}>Chorus</Text>
      <Text>
        Let all hail Jesus
        <br />
        Let all hail Jesus
        <br />
        Let all hail Jesus
        <br />
        As the earth wails Jesus

        Behold, He cometh with clouds;
        <br />
        And every eye shall see Him,
        <br />
        And they also which pierced Him:
        <br />
        And all kindreds of the earth
        <br />
        Shall wail because of Him.
        <br />
        Even so Hallelujah
