        When I disappoint You, the heavens react
        <br />
        That’s how You show me just how much You love
        <br />
        When I disobey You, the heavens react
        <br />
        Just to show how much You’re jealous for me
        <br />
        Teach me to make all of the heaven’s rejoice
        <br />
        For the heavens rejoice when I’m walking in truth
