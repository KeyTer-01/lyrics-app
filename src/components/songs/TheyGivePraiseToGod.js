        They give praise to God and to the Lamb
        <br />
        And To Him who sits upon the Throne
        <br />
        All the people standing on Mount Zion
        <br />
        They will now sing a song
        <br />
        Song of God and the Lamb
        <br />
        We are the people standing on Mount Zion
        <br />
        And we now sing a song
        <br />
        Song of God and the Lamb

      <Text as={"b"}>Verse 1</Text>
      <Text>
        In their mouth, in their mouth was found no guile
        <br />
        They are found without fault before the Throne of God
        <br />
        They which were not defiled with women, they are virgins
        <br />
        They follow the Lamb whithersoever He goeth
      </Text>

      <Text as={"b"}>Verse 2</Text>
      <Text>
        They were redeemed from amongst men
        <br />
        They are first fruits unto our God and unto the Lamb
      </Text>
