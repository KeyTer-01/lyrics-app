        I will be extra in my loving of Jesus
        <br />
        I’ll do it like I’m mad oh
        <br />
        My own will be too much
        <br />
        For the kind of mercy God has had on me
        <br />
        Is the mercy of those forgiven much

        I will be extravagant in my worship
        <br />
        I’ll do it like I’m crazy
        <br />
        Watch me burn and be blessed
        <br />
        For the kind of loving God is loving me
        <br />
        Is the loving of those to whom much is given

        I’ll be the only one that returns to say
        <br />
        I’m grateful for the cleansing
        <br />
        You can have me and my household if You care
        <br />
        To my third and fourth generation
        <br />
        My posterity will do what You’ve commanded
        <br />
        For we know we’re unprofitable servants
        <br />
        Only doing our duties

        My alabaster
        <br />
        Box I’ll break at your feet
        <br />
        To kiss Your feet I won’t cease
        <br />
        And wipe it clean with my hair
        <br />
        For the kind of loving God is loving me
        <br />
        Is the loving of those to whom much is given

        If I endure temptation, I’m only doing my duty

        If I praise and worship, I’m only doing my duty

        If I read Your word, I’m only doing my duty

        If I obey commandments, I’m only doing my duty

        If I follow Jesus, I’m only doing my duty
