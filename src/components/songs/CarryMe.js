        Come carry me away in the spirit

        To your great and high mountain

        And show me that great city

        The Holy Jerusalem
        <br />
        <br />
        Descending out of heaven from God

        Having the glory of God

        Most precious

        A stone as clear as a crystal
        <br />
        Having a wall great and high

        Come and make me your bride
