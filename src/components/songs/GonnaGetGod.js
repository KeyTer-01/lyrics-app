        Generation G, not Z, where God is the focus
        <br />
        Not sold to the internet but to the laws and tenets
        <br />
        New Testament, fused in my blood, no violence
        <br />
        No drugs, we stay high in the spirit like incense
        <br />
        Christ sense to the natural man is nonsense
        <br />
        But we don’t care, our righteous judge is the host now
        <br />
        For the gain and for the fame we'd rather be slain
        <br />
        And go through the pain it's okay if that's how we attain
        <br />
        Learning the school of the spirit like 123
        <br />
        Decoding mysteries of sin like ABC
        <br />
        Shield of faith so strong like mustard seed
        <br />
        Bearing fruits in the spirit

        We’re coming out of the Ur of Chaldeas
        <br />
        We lay down our Isaacs
        <br />
        We’re looking for a city Which has foundations
        <br />
        Whose builder and maker is God
        <br />
        He’s El-Elohim
        <br />
        El-Elyon
        <br />
        El-Shaddai
        <br />
        And flesh shall die

        Not the wine of the world, we get drunk in the Spirit
        <br />
        Not the parties or the club, we've got joy in his presense
        <br />
        No Zodiac, we're sons, we're led by the spirit
        <br />
        Not the trends or the tacts, we know we're following the lamb
        <br />
        Zion is my city, Christ is my identity
        <br />
        Holy jerusalem city of peace is where I'm from
        <br />
        Our language is the world to come of whom we speak
        <br />
        Mekesunda yeah, don’t blame me, I'm just speaking my tongue
        <br />
        We’re Crucified to the world and the world to us
        <br />
        There ain't no meeting point cause I've been crushed If I die to christ
        then I'll bounce back up
        <br />
        New and living way you know what it is that's what it is
        <br />
        That's what he left for us

        I've got Christ on my mind
        <br />
        I don’t care what you believe
        <br />
        you can go and chase the dough
        <br />
        I'm just gonna save my soul
        <br />
        You keep chasing the moolah, papers, they'll end up in furnace
        <br />
        I'll chase enduring substance and end up in life abundance
        <br />
        I’m gonna Get God (x3)

        <br />
        It ain’t easy, I won’t lie
        <br />
        For this cause yeah, He died
        <br />
        I'm on a journey I'll stay focused
        <br />
        Every single thing I'm letting go
        <br />
        They chase the fame but we gonna seek his name
        <br />
        They wanna be the face but we gonna seek his face
        <br />
        For us to live is Christ and to die is gain
        <br />
        and if I die today I’mma ressurect again
        <br />

        <br />
        You got no time to face the book
