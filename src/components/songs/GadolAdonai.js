      <Text>
        Here in a dark place
        <br />
        As in the dark even now
        <br />
        Out of the darkness
        <br />
        I see the daystar arise
        <br />
        <br />
        To give the knowledge
        <br />
        Of salvation unto men
        <br />
        That sit in darkness
        <br />
        And in the shadow of death
      </Text>
      <br />
      <Text>Pre-Chorus</Text>
      <Text>
        Through the tender mercy of our God
        <br />
        Whereby the day spring from on high
        <br />
        Has visited us

        Gadol Adonai
        <br />
        Shalom, shalom
        <br />
        Gadol Elohim
        <br />
        Shalom, shalom

      <Text>Pre-Chorus</Text>
      <Text>
        Here in a dark place
        <br />
        As in a glass we do behold
        <br />
        With open faces
        <br />
        To see the glory of the Lord
        <br />
        <br />
        Though we see darkly
        <br />
        As in a mirror we behold
        <br />
        But then face to face we
        <br />
        Will know even as we are known
      </Text>
