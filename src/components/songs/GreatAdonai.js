        Who laid the beam of His chambers in the waters
        <br />
        Great Adonai, Great Adonai!
        <br />
        Who rides upon the clouds as a chariot
        <br />
        Great Elohim, Great Elohim!
        <br />
        Who rides upon the wings of the wind
        <br />
        Great Adonai, Great Adonai!
        <br />
        Who laid the foundations of the earth
        <br />
        Great Elohim, Great Elohim!
        <br />
        And He covered it with the deep as a garment
        <br />
        Great Adonai, Great Adonai!
        <br />
        Great and greatly to be praised
        <br />
        Great Elohim, Great Elohim!
        <br />
        <br />
        Who clothes Himself with honour and majesty
        <br />
        Great Adonai, Great Adonai!
        <br />
        Who covers Himself with light as a garment
        <br />
        Great Elohim, Great Elohim!
        <br />
        Who stretched out the heaven like a curtain
        <br />
        Great Adonai, Great Adonai!
        <br />
        He makes His Angels spirits, His ministers a flame of fire
        <br />
        Great Elohim, Elohim!
