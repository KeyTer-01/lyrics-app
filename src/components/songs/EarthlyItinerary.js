        It’s a long night
        <br />
        On the long walk to glory
        <br />
        You want me to take flight
        <br />
        To mount up with wings like an eagle
        <br />
        That I may see far
        <br />
        I’ll walk and not be weary
        <br />
        I'll run and I will not faint
        <br />
        Through the womb of the morning
        <br />
        <br />
        And I’ll see the Son of God
        <br />
        On the right hand of glory
        <br />
        I'll see the Son of God
        <br />
        Shining in the Most Holy
        <br />
        <br />
        Where the Son of God is seated
        <br />
        On the right hand of glory
        <br />
        The Majesty on High
        <br />
        Majesty on High
        <br />
        This is my earthly itinerary
