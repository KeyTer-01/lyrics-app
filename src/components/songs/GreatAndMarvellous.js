        Great and marvelous are your works Lord God Almighty
        <br />
        Just and true are your ways
        <br />
        You who are the king of the saints
        <br />
        Who shall not fear Thee, O Lord?
        <br />
        And glorify your name for You alone are Holy
        <br />
        All nations shall come and worship before thee
        <br />
        Your judgements are made manifest
        <br />
        This is the song of the lamb

        I saw and I saw
        <br />
        As it were a sea of glass mingled with fire
        <br />
        And they that have gotten the victory over the beast
        <br />
        Over his image, and over his mark
        <br />
        <br />
        Over the number of his name
        <br />
        They stand on the sea of glass
        <br />
        Having the harps of God
        <br />
        They sing the song of Moses
        <br />
        The servant of God
        <br />
        <br />
        The song of the lamb
        <br />
        They are saying to him
        <br />
        Great and marvelous are your works
