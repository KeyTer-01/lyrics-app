        Give unto the Lord glory and strength.

        And in His temple does every one speak of His glory.

        The Lord sits upon the flood; yea,

        The Lord sits King for ever.

        The Lord is upon many waters.

        The Voice Of The Lord breaks the cedars;
        <br />
        The Lord breaks the cedars of Lebanon.

        He makes them also to skip like a calf;
        <br />
        Lebanon and Sirion like a young unicorn.

        The Voice Of The Lord divides the flames of fire.

        The Voice Of The Lord shakes the wilderness;
        <br />
        The Lord shakes the wilderness of Kadesh.
        <br />
        The Voice Of The Lord makes the hinds to calve,
        <br />
        And discovers the forests
